# Limit and offset have different names in the Prisma API:

# The limit is called take, meaning you’re “taking” x elements after a provided start index.
# The start index is called skip, since you’re skipping that many elements in the list before collecting the items to be returned. If skip is not provided, it’s 0 by default. The pagination then always starts from the beginning of the list. So, go ahead and add the skip and take arguments to the feed query.
